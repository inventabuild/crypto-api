## Short Project Description
An API based program for obtaining quotes on cryptocurrencies via popular web browsers.

The website uses html, css and Javascript.

Futuer enhancements include watching more than one cryptocurrency, live updates and charts.

## User Stories
User Story 1, As someone interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, I want to obtain cryptocurrency prices without requiring an account sign-in, so I don't have to take time to sign-in for quotes.

User Story 2, As an investor in cryptocurrencies, I want a screen dedicated to cryptocurrency prices, so I don't get bombarded by adverstisements whenever I want to retrieve prices.

User Story 3, As an investor that uses the 200 day moving average of publicly traded assets for making investment decisions, I wanted a screen that showed the 200 day moving average of cryptocurrencies, so I don't have to use a 2nd screen or app to obtain this information.
